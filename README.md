# Nodechat

A NSS classroom project building a chat application built with Socket.io

### Goal

Create a basic chat application using Socket.io and PostgreSQL.  Should be able to open two browser windows and chat between the two, having each message appear in the other window as well as your own.

### Tools Used

Node, Express, Socket.io, PostgreSQL, Jade, Nodemon, Code editor

### Installation

Create new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/nodechat.git
```

Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Now start your regular Node server with this Terminal command:

```sh
$ npm run start
```

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ in two different browser windows to start and use the application!
